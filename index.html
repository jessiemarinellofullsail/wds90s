		<p>Ahh the 90s.  Even though I was born right in the middle of the 80s, I am a chid of the 90s.  It's what I remember. It's something I miss. It's something I enjoy.  TV was simpler, funnier, and had the best theme songs.  Sing a few lines of "In west Philadelphia" or "Well, I wake every morning" 
		and chances are any kid of the 90s can not only tell you the name of the TV show (<em>Fresh Prince of Bel Air and Saved by the Bell</em>) but finish the song. Friday was TGIF in front of the tube. Saturday morning cartoons were worth getting up for. After all that TV watching, it was imperative to
		sit down with a good book.  Enter Goosebumps, the fantastically spooky, yet hokey series by R.L. Stine. Then, you go go to Pizza Hut and get your free personal pan pizza..just for reading! Going to school used to be fun.  You could pack your lunch in an awesome plastic lunch box that came in every 
		color imaginable. Your books were inevitably wrapped in brown paper grocery bags, perfect for writing on with scented markers - close your eyes and guess what color! You could decorate your TrapperKeeper with your newest Lisa Frank sticker collection. After lunch you could have free time and play 
		Oregon Trail and experience the incredible marvel that was Windows 95. Then there were the toys. Glorious toys. Nickelodeon Gak, anyone? And even though I never became a fan myself, I am pretty sure that POGS were all the rage. Slap bracelets could double as toys. Your collection of Troll dolls
		was a source of great pride and fear for anyone over the age of 13. After school activities could consist of going home and popping in a VHS with a recorded episode of Reading Rainbow.  Or you could wait for your favorite song to come on the radio and time it just right to record on tape. That way
		you could dance to the Macarena all night long.  These are just a few of the things I remember off hand and love about the 90s.  Become a member of our site so you can share your favorites with the rest of us.</p>
